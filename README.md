 <p>I'm still figuring out how to best organize the files that I will be using and outputting for the program. So far, I've made an R project file and stored it in the project folder. The next thing I need to figure out is how organize the files per each course making up the entire program. Questions...
  <ol>
   <li>Should I create a separate R project file for each course and store it in a folder within the main project folder?</li>
   <li>Is #1 possible and is it best practice?</li>
   <li>Organize all files for the entire program by type?</li>
   <li>Organize by course then organize by file type within each course folder/project?</li>
  </ol>
 </p>
 <p>That's all for now. Be back when I figure out what to do.</p>
